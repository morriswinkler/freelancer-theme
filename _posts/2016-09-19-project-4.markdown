description: My experiences with microcontrollers, sensors and actuators are diverse. I have been working with Atmel AVR, Texas Instruments msp430, NXP LPC and others. This image depicts a small prototype of an Arduino based dosing pump. It was part of a larger setup for a new manufacturing process for design tiles I helped to develop.
