description: My experience with microcontrollers, sensors and actuators are diverse. I have been working with Atmel AVR, Texas Instruments msp430, NXP LPC and others. This is a small prototype of an Arduino based dosing pump. It is part of a larger setup for a new manufacturing process that I helped to develop.
